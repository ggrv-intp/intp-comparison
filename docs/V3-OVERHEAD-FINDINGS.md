# V3 overhead findings (motivation for V3.2)

This document summarises the empirical V3 measurements that motivated
the design of V3.2. It is the in-repo digest of paper section VI
(overhead decomposition). V3 itself is not deprecated: it remains the
introspection-friendly profiler and the *predecessor of record* for
V3.2's architectural decisions.

For full numbers, raw traces, and the paper-grade exposition, see:

- Specific run logs under `bench/findings/`.

## 1. System-wide context-switch amplification: 188-390x

Under steady-state load on `intp-master` (Xeon Gold 5412U / Sapphire
Rapids, kernel 6.8), V3 amplifies the host's system-wide
context-switch rate by a factor of **188x to 390x** depending on the
workload class. Idle floor and bursty I/O are at the low end of the
range; CPU-bound multithreaded workloads (HiBench Spark stages,
`stress-ng --cpu`) are at the high end.

### Measurement caveat

The amplification is observed via **`vmstat 1`** (the
`/proc/stat::ctxt` counter). `perf stat -e sched:sched_switch` reports
roughly 3 orders of magnitude *less* because V3's BPF program is
attached to the same `sched_switch` tracepoint that perf is sampling:
the BPF handler runs first and then the perf sample is taken, so the
sample slot is consumed by V3's own work and the "real" ctxsws under
load are not represented in the perf histogram. `vmstat` is the
ground-truth counter; perf under-reports by construction whenever a
BPF program is attached to the same tracepoint.

This is the single most surprising finding from the V3 campaign and
the reason `bench/v3-overhead-vmstat.sh` exists.

## 2. Decomposition: 50/50 between two structurally coupled mechanisms

The amplification splits roughly evenly between:

- **Mech #1 -- Consumer wakeups.** Every time a worker thread fires a
  probe, V3's BPF program reserves a slot in a 16 MiB
  `BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF` and either calls `bpf_ringbuf_submit` or
  the kernel flushes once the wakeup threshold is reached. The
  userspace `intp` consumer is `epoll`-blocked on the ring's poll
  fd; the submit/flush wakes it, the kernel context-switches into
  the consumer, the consumer drains the ring, and goes back to
  sleep. Each round trip is one ctxsw, by construction.

- **Mech #2 -- Induced preemption of co-resident workers.** The
  consumer thread, once woken, runs on whatever CPU the scheduler
  hands it. On a CPU-bound workload, that CPU was already running
  a worker; the consumer's slice preempts it, the worker
  context-switches out, the consumer drains, the consumer goes
  back to sleep, the worker context-switches back in. That is two
  more ctxsws per drain on top of the wakeup itself.

### Why this is not load-dependent

Each Mech #1 wakeup *is* a Mech #2 preemption opportunity by
construction: the wakeup *has to* land on some CPU, and on a
saturated host that CPU is by definition running a worker. So the
two mechanisms are not independent contributors that happen to be
balanced -- they are coupled by the architecture of "drain a ring
buffer from a userspace thread". The split is 50/50 by design, not
by happy accident. Removing one without removing the other is
structurally impossible inside the streaming pattern. Removing both
is what V3.2 does by aggregating in-kernel and polling once per
interval.

## 3. mbw normalisation: silent clipping and discrete-outlier artifact

V3's `resctrl_read_mbm_delta()` normalises memory bandwidth as
`100 * bytes_per_sec / INTP_MEM_BW_MBPS_BYTES`. On `intp-master`,
`INTP_MEM_BW_MBPS` is 281 600 (8 DDR5 channels times the per-channel
theoretical peak). Two failure modes:

1. **Silent saturation at 100%.** When the observed bandwidth
   exceeds the configured ceiling -- which happens whenever the
   ceiling is misconfigured, or when a workload pushes past the
   theoretical peak under measurement skew -- V3 clips at 100% with
   no warning. The trailing fraction is lost.

2. **Discrete outliers (96, 80, 64, 48, 32, 16, 0).** When one or
   more of the 8 memory channels read as zero in a sample window,
   the normalised value lands on a multiple of `100 / 8 = 12.5%`,
   rounded -- producing the bimodal pattern of discrete outliers
   that was initially misread as a measurement artifact. The cause
   is per-channel zero reads, not a normalisation bug per se; the
   bug is that V3 cannot tell zero-read from genuinely-zero
   bandwidth and the clipping/discretisation hide both.

### Confirming the signal is real

The resctrl-derived `mbw` byte counter (read separately, before any
normalisation) shows the actual noise-floor bandwidth at about
**5.65 GB/s** under idle load on `intp-master`. The signal is
present and non-zero; V3's binary normalisation is what produces
the misleading display. V3.2 emits both `mbw_pct` (normalised) and
`mbw_raw_mbps` (the raw byte rate), so consumers can detect either
failure mode immediately. Clipping at 100% is opt-in via
`--clip-mbw` rather than the default.

## 4. Why V3 stays in the repo

V3 is retained as the predecessor of V3.2 for two reasons:

1. **Empirical justification.** The overhead measurements above are
   the empirical evidence that motivates the in-kernel-aggregation
   architecture. Removing V3 would orphan that evidence chain. Any
   future reviewer who asks "why not just stream events?" should be
   able to run V3 and reproduce the 188-390x amplification on their
   own host.

2. **Per-event introspection.** V3 retains `--trace` mode and the
   MPSC FIFO ordering of probe events that V3.2 trades away. For
   debugging individual probe sites or chasing causal ordering bugs,
   the streaming pattern is the right tool. V3.2 is the right tool
   for steady-state interference characterisation.

V3 is the *introspection profiler*; V3.2 is the *steady-state
profiler*. Both have a home.
